I’ll spare the details of my stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but basically, I had received two really nice baby carriers as gifts before Jonathan was born. Today, I went to the market and I saw a lady with two young children. One was walking alongside her and one was in a carrier, but the carrier seemed poorly made and if you’ve ever worn your baby (it’s a thing), you know how it can hurt your back even if you have a high quality carrier. After having Jonathan, I’ve been extra sensitive, almost to the touch, when it comes to other moms and babies, etc. I immediately thought of my extra carrier (brand new, that I was trying to sell as we leave) and asked her if she needed a new one. She declined, but the point is… actually I have two points, kind of intertwined.</p>
<ol>
  <li>As I offered my extra carrier, because I wasn’t using it, I felt FREE to give it to a complete stranger. I was excited, actually, to give it to someone who needed it. I had an <em>excess</em>. As I thought more about it, I saw an analogy of what love from the Father is like. I have been and am fully satisfied because I find everything I need in knowing Christ; there is an OVERFLOW (even when I do not believe it). I cannot contain it. And when thinking about this abounding love, the <em>riches</em> of knowing God, of having <strong>true life</strong>, I should be so much more excited and <em>convicted</em> in needing to share it, knowing it can make an eternal difference. I think of Stephen, who boldly preached and though he was hated and stoned, he knew he had nothing to lose because Jesus was the one receiving his spirit (Acts 7:59)!</li>
  <li>As we’ve been getting ready to leave, all I’ve been thinking about is “WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET FOR CAMBODIA?” After hearing about how difficult the heat and just the changes in air quality, cleanliness, etc. compared to America are, I wanted to gear up, with the hopes that it would make us more comfortable and maybe even help us stay in Cambodia longer (wow, what am I even thinking, right?). I have been so caught up in preparing ourselves physically, when I really should be preparing my heart, focusing more on why we are going, having God’s perspective, asking Him for help, feeding on the Word desperately, and taking advantage of the great spiritual resources God has provided here. Not to mention the several generations of missionaries who had no access to purified water or vaccines, but clung to Christ day after day. <strong>This is not to say that there aren’t other reasons missionaries need to and should go home. Of course these are good things and can be extremely helpful. I’m talking about depending on physical comforts for longevity in the mission field.</strong> In the end, it won’t be sweating too much or all the mosquito bites that will cause us to go back home. It will be a lackluster vision of Christ. It will be selfishness and pride. It will be a failure to see the people in Cambodia the way God does. It will be the heart. What’s more important than bringing what we have in the States to Cambodia, mainly, comfort, is being <em>grounded and rooted in God’s Word</em>, <strong>walking in the Spirit</strong>. In the same way, Stephen had God’s heart for those who were lost. He had his mind set on eternal things, on truth! He loved them as God loves us; he prayed for them, asking God not to hold their sin against them (Acts 8:60)! He was not concerned with himself, but with the lost. Man, I want to be rid of such worldly pursuits and desires. I want to live simply, because I don’t need all that stuff!</li>
</ol>

<p>All that being said, we will be leaving the States August 15th and we need your prayers. Of course we always do, but there are times when God helps us to see this more than others. My mom recently reminded me that we are in a battle against the prince of the power of the air and this is always true. <strong>Please pray that we would train ourselves for godliness, that we would follow the good Shepherd with complete surrender, and that we would entrust ourselves to the Father as Jesus did, being armed with Truth as we leave.</strong></p>

<p>Logistically, things are going well. We are still getting rid of things and seeing what we can fit into suitcases. This is also Ryan’s last week of work. There have been some frantic moments as we cancel auto-payments and those kinds of things, but overall, we have not been overly worried or stressed! Praise God!</p>

<p><span class="image_container left sm"><img src="../../../../images/friends/with_delanos_peniel-0e348680.jpg" alt="At Peniel Ranch with the Delanos" /> At Peniel Ranch with those faithful servants, Dennis and Darlene Delano </span> We are so thankful for how God has been helping us see our insufficiency in the flesh and in finances by showing us His provision through the church body and His Word. The last few weeks spent with family and our church in Spokane have been so sweet and we are reminded that God is more faithful than we could ask for!</p>
<ul>
  <li>We were able to have a mini-vacation with Ryan’s family at a Christian ranch run by faithful servants who encouraged us in many ways</li>
  <li>Our church family prayed for us and encouraged us at lovely picnic</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="image_container right sm"><img src="../../../../images/other/goodbye_cake_spokane-321b6318.jpg" alt="Goodbye Cake" /> A cake our church got for us and another family (of 9!) that is moving to Germany with the Air Force who you can pray for, too! </span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Many people have been offering to help us with meals, luggage, and housing!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please also pray that our time spent with friends and family as we drive down the West Coast would be intentional and edifying.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your prayers and love. <em>Please</em> let us know how we can be praying for you as well.</p>

<p>Ryan and Rebekah</p>
