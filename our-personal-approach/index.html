What happens is that while sometimes not asking is motivated by conviction (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Taylor">Hudson Taylor</a>), sometimes this is motivated by a desire to not have to ask for money!</p>

<p><span class="image_container right sm"><img src="../images/other/hudson_taylor-3000d51a.jpg" alt="Hudson Taylor" /> A young Hudson Taylor</span> For us, we have had to prayerfully consider how to approach this. We do not believe that it is inappropriate to ask for support (of any kind, financial support included). In fact, in our opinion there is a certain amount of honor in being willing to ask when there is a need. This is why <a href="https://sojournerandstranger.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/christmas-in-cambodia/">previously Ryan had asked</a> for financial support to go on a scouting trip to Cambodia in 2015. His reasoning behind this was that ultimately, he was not asking for money for himself, but rather for the sake of the Great Commission. To a degree, we would affirm something similar today ‚Äî especially for a short-term trip, where funds go towards the trip and not towards personal living expenses.</p>

<p>At the same time, we need to avoid the temptation to view godliness as a means of financial gain (1 Timothy 6:5-11). There is a lot more we could say on this, but to avoid going into too much detail, allow us to summarize. We will adopt the following policies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We will not ask for financial support or take actions with the purpose in mind of raising financial support for ourselves.</li>
  <li>At the same time, we will not refuse the gift itself. In fact, we will be very grateful for whatever anyone has to give! But our hope is that our hearts will always be the same as the Apostle Paul‚Äôs, when he says: ‚Äúnot that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account.‚Äù (Philippians 4:10-19).
    <ul>
      <li>We are reaching out now and will continue to reach out in the future most of all so that you can so that you can partner with us in ministry no matter what that looks like. In fact this is our primary goal in maintaining this website.</li>
      <li>If God has placed the desire on your heart to give financially, then praise the Lord. If not, then praise the Lord! We know that there are a lot of needs and a lot of great things going on around the world. We‚Äôll point some out myself when we see them. Our goal is not that we would have a flourishing ministry, our goal is that gospel ministry would happen no matter who is doing it. If at some point it becomes apparent that the best way for us to serve Christ is by getting a side job to keep us on the field, then we will do so with joy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nevertheless, we will let you know if we need to get a job while serving overseas or especially if we have to leave the field.
    <ul>
      <li>If we do, please do not take this in the wrong way. If we do need to work, then we will take that as a sign that God desires the job to be part of our ministry. We firmly believe that ‚Äî although sometimes God uses the contributions of the saints as part of how He opens doors ‚Äî money is not required to do ministry.</li>
      <li>At the same time, many of you have expressed a desire for us to be able to focus our attention working directly with the church and to give towards that end. Therefore, we do want to keep you informed as those who are sharing in our ministry. This way you‚Äôll know how to pray for us and will be able to give with intentionality if God has placed the desire to give on your heart.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We also ask that you would join with us for the sake of the gospel in other ways. We cannot travel this journey alone! In fact, we hope that we never cease coveting your prayers and fellowship! But we also hope that both all of us will truly appreciate the fact that ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is not synonymous with ‚Äúdonate‚Äù (there‚Äôs more to it than that!).</li>
  <li>We do recognize that this is an area of Christian freedom (see 1 Corinthians 9), and not the only way for missionaries to do this. But we do believe that this is the best way for us and our circumstances.</li>
  <li>If at all possible, we do not want to bring up money issues beyond just this once. Our heart is to just put all of my cards on the table and speak forthrightly so that there is no miscommunication down the road.</li>
  <li>Nevertheless, please feel free to ask questions if this is confusing. üôÇ</li>
