Thank you for your prayers during our two-week quarantine upon returning to Cambodia, our time tranisitioning back to life here, and for Ryan’s class at the Phnom Penh Bible School. Our quarantine was indeed not without challenges, but with many, many more blessings.</p>

<h2 id="phnom-penh-bible-school">Phnom Penh Bible School</h2>
<p><span class="image_container right lg"><img src="../../../../images/cambodia/ppbs/ryan_hebrews_2021-bb94f629.jpg" alt="Ryan teaching at PPBS" /> Ryan introducing the book of Hebrews </span>First of all, thank you for your prayers regarding teaching at the Bible School. I finished my third lecture this week, and there have been both many points of encouragement and many points of discouragement along the way. The whole process of trying to get ready for the class, particularly due to challenges involved with teaching online, has been quite humbling. For one thing, all the students are learning from their hometowns in the countryside which means they are less likely to have solid internet connection or a dedicated studying area/time due to family duties. As many of you have experienced during the last year, there are other the difficulties of learning virtually in front of a screen for hours each day as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, we are entrusting the results to God and hoping that it is a help to these students as they seek to know the God of the Bible by digging into his Word. The most encouraging thing is to see the students do their best to overcome the less than ideal learning environment so that they can grow personally as well as become equipped for future ministry. On the first day of class, the students shared that they are studying at the Bible School because even beyond a personal desire to know God and go deep into His Word, they want to use what they learn in ministries ranging from Pastor, to Bible Teacher, youth and children’s ministry, evangelism, and being a missionary.</p>

<h2 id="cambodia">Cambodia</h2>

<p>In general the coronavirus has been pretty mild in Cambodia overall, particularly when in comparison to other countries around the world. However, starting around the time when we got out of the quarantine in the beginning of March, the situation started to escalate some and regulations started to tighten.</p>

<p><span class="image_group align-center wrap"><span class="image_container med"><img src="../../../../images/cambodia/covid/chhoukmeas_before-54987eec.jpg" alt="Psar Chhouk Meas" /> The largest market in our area on a normal day </span> <span class="image_container med"><img src="../../../../images/cambodia/covid/chhoukmeas_after-a586417c.jpg" alt="Psar Chhouk Meas during Lockdown" /> During lockdown– a ghost town! </span></span></p>

<p>As of today, Phnom Penh (Cambodia’s capital city) is totally locked down, meaning that apart from what is deemed necessary, everyone is supposed to stay in their houses. Some parts of the city are closed down more than others. Many markets are completely closed, and some have limited access to food. For us, we are not severely affected personally. We have been thankful to have access to food and a little neighborhood where walking around outside isn’t prohibited.</p>

<p>But we are praying and hoping that the situation will loosen up soon for the sake of the country as a whole. Generally, there is a lot of fear and sometimes even panic as rules change from week to week. It is nearing the end of our third week under these circumstances, but it seems like the lockdown will be lifted soon, if there are no sudden changes! Praise God!</p>

<h2 id="home--family">Home &amp; Family</h2>

<p><span class="image_container left med"><img src="../../../../images/us/2021_return_pp/reunited_w_chheangs-ca59328b.jpg" alt="With Bora and Bunry Chheang" /> With some teammates before lockdown, the Chheangs </span> We are very grateful to be able to settle into our new house. Our teammates here in Cambodia helped us out so much in transitioning from life overseas to being back in the country. One thing in particular that we are excited about is the new neighborhood that we are in. Due to various social dynamics, it was much harder to get to know people in the previous neighborhood in contrast to the place we are now. It seems like even despite COVID, we have been able to get to meet more families here in our new (much smaller) neighborhood after a couple months than we did in the whole year and a half that we were in the previous neighborhood. One family we met is a family of missionaries from Fiji. We were going for a walk around the neighborhood when we heard a Christian tune, and went out on a limb and yelled hello from the street to see what would happen. Though we haven’t been able to spend that much time with them due to COVID, overall we are encouraged by their faith and the testimony that they seem to have in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>We have also met a Korean family who are also missionaries here, as well as some Buddhist Khmer families. Many families have children around the age of Jonathan and Samuel, so we’re looking forward to being able to spend more time with them as time goes on, especially once COVID loosens up a little.</p>

<p><span class="image_group align-right wrap"><span class="image_container sm"><img src="../../../../images/us/2021_return_pp/brothers-6ecaf6da.jpg" alt="At home" /> Monkeys! </span><span class="image_container sm"><img src="../../../../images/us/2021_return_pp/neighborhood_walks-cb6388a8.jpg" alt="Neighborhood Walks" /> Jonathan’s first bike just in time for the lockdown! </span></span> The kids have adjusted very well to our new home, weather, and the language, people and culture. Jonathan is more interested in learning Khmer, especially because he wants to play with Khmer kids! He patiently listens as I read him childrens’ books in Khmer despite not understanding much. We struck by gratitude when we think about how God is shaping our children, and how sweet and beautiful they are, and often how soft their hearts are.</p>

<p>We have seen that our energy levels seem to deplete sooner than before, but that may be for a number of reasons! There is of course having two mobile tikes, returning to the hot season in Cambodia, and unpacking/organizing, but then also — we are expecting our third child in August! Throughout it all, God has been gracious in His provision for strength, His reminders of our hope and joy in Him, and even small things, like the rainy season coming sooner than we had expected, bringing cool refreshment with it.</p>

<p>Ryan is continuing to work in the evenings after the kids’ bedtime and we are grateful for the opportunity he has with the American company we works for. It has been a bit tiring and unavoidably humbling, but it is indeed a gift as well. Despite all this, it seems like we have made more intentional time for our marriage than we have had in the past; we are encouraged and blessed!</p>

<p><span class="image_container right sm"><img src="../../../../images/us/2021_return_pp/ryan_bday-7b83d78f.jpg" alt="Ryan's 30th Birthday" /> We celebrated all three of these guys’ birthdays after arriving! </span>We are grateful for where we are, how smooth the transition was back into Cambodia, and the manifold blessings we’ve received from God during the last couple months. In particular, some things that can often become stressors for us, we have been able to work through by God’s grace, and are finding peace and joy in the work He has called us to here.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your prayers, we are confident that God is using them to build His church here in Cambodia.</p>

<p>In Him,<br />
Ryan and Rebekah</p>
