In Hebrews 5:11-13, the author of Hebrews reprimands the church for their lack of maturity and growth in Christ, comparing them to infants who can handle only “milk” (i.e., elementary topics) but are unable to eat “solid food” (i.e., going deep into the Word). In 5:14, he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my professors from Master’s College once pointed out how in Greek the words “good” (καλοῦ) and “evil” (κακοῦ) look almost identical. The only difference between the words for “good” and “evil” is a small stroke separating the Greek letters λ from κ. This nuance helps to highlight how difficult it often is to tell the difference between what’s right and what’s wrong.</p>

<p><span class="image_container med left"><img src="../../../../images/cambodia/people/bora_Andrew_Ryan_Samphors_2023-632554fe.jpg" alt="" /> Eating together at Pastor Andrew’s house</span> Earlier this month we went on a trip to visit a pastor in the province, who grows rice to help provide for his family. During the visit, the pastor showed us his rice field.</p>

<p>As we walked along the rice paddies the pastor pointed out that when farmers didn’t take care of their fields enough, grass would sprout up, mixed in among the rice.</p>

<p>What was striking though was that even after he pointed out the grass, I couldn’t tell the difference from the grass and the rice at all. You could say my eyes were not “trained by constant practice” to be able to distinguish between the difference.</p>

<p><span class="image_container lg right"><img src="../../../../images/cambodia/nature/takeo_p_andrew_ricefield_1-f12a96f5.jpeg" alt="" /> Can you tell what is grass and what is rice in this picture? </span></p>

<p>Sometimes, there are things in our lives which in other circumstances, are fine and well, but when they take us away from what is more important or urgent, then it actually becomes “evil” for us. For the students, I brought up sports, hanging out with friends, or spending time on the phone - things that are not inherently bad, but when they distract us from spiritual disciplines like time in the Word and prayer, slowly but surely we can start to get further and further from Christ.</p>

<p>The author of Hebrews calls this “drift” (2:1):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without realizing it, we can slowly lose become less full of love for our Savior, less zealous for His bride the Church, and less passionate for the lost – all because we have allowed distractions into our lives due to our lack of wisdom and discernment. Is it an exaggeration to say that a lack of spiritual discernment, which leads to distraction and drifting away from Christ, is <strong>one of the greatest threats to the Church today</strong>, just as it always has been even during the time when Hebrews was first written?</p>

<p><strong>Pray for the Church in Cambodia</strong>, as phones and other technology have taken over the country, and pastors wrestle with how to shepherd their people in response. Pray that the pastors <em>would</em> wrestle with how to shepherd the flock in regard to these things. Praise the Lord for the churches here that are vigilent and growing in regard to these things.</p>

<p><strong>Pray also for us.</strong> The topic of discernment and wisdom has been especially on our hearts lately as we feeling stretched thin. We are of course grateful for lots of opportunity, but realize we have probably taken on too much…Weekends in particular end up looking like each of us taking turns with the kids while the other crashes in exhaustion. On the other hand, pray we wouldn’t let tiredness keep us from what the Lord has called all of us to either, as we seek to build up the church and reach the lost.</p>

<p>Lately we’ve been making time to visit churches we are connected to in some way. It has been encouraging to worship together with and learn from the believers of these different churches. <br />

<h1 id="prayer-requests">Prayer Requests</h1>
<ul>
  <li>We recently met with a couple of the missionary families from Ratanakiri Province (they were visiting Phnom Penh for a few days) and had a good time of fellowship. We are continuing to confirm plans to work with them starting early 2025 as well as other logistical/ministry details. Thank you for your continued prayer for this developing partnership for the gospel.</li>
  <li>Rebekah is pregnant with our fourth, who is due in October. Praise God for this gift, but also prayer for energy for Rebekah (especially with wanting to be faithful to ministry opportunities and training up our first three kids in the meantime)</li>
  <li>One concern has been seeing some indications of a lack of clarity in regard to some key gospel truths in students’ lives. Of course, all of us need these reminders about fundamental gospel realities - but just to say, pray for more opportunities to point students back to the gospel.</li>
  <li>Pray for Shalom Phnom Penh Church, as the church transitions after Pastor Chanthea steps down to go back to school.</li>
</ul>
