First of all - thank you to all who wrote, and for reaching out to us in that regard. We really do appreciate the care that so many have expressed on our behalf.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we did want to clarify one thing in particular. Perhaps because our newsletters are often only sent out once every 2-3 months, but we really are engaged with much less than it might appear. Furthermore, the pictures we post often highlight the <em>variety</em> over against the regular, unchanging, day-in day-out ministry that is more typical and characteristic of what our lives here consist of.</p>

<p>You might say, “Well why not put pictures that are more typical then?” The fact is, if we sent a picture of a more typical day in ministry, it would mostly look the same from week to week, month to month, and year to year: Ryan sitting at a desk, pouring over the Scriptures - or perhaps a picture of Rebekah, engaged in casual conversation over lunch with someone from church. However, for better or for worse, I am not apt to take pictures of myself sitting at my desk - hence why the pictures that end up in the newsletters tend to be more dynamic, and therefore less representative of our actual typical activities.</p>

<p>To which you might reply, “Well wouldn’t putting these pictures still be better? Isn’t accuracy and communicating a true picture of your ministry more valuable than exciting newsletters with fun pictures?” To which I would respond, that yes, that’s quite reasonable and well worth considering, and is perhaps a fault that should be corrected.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I thought that it might be beneficial to write this brief clarification. My particular concern to clarify this comes in part so as to not misrepresent what we are doing here, but also particularly so as to not lead to any confusion about the nature of ministry and missions in general. In many ways, there is nothing “glorious” about missions. Relatively speaking, there is a lot more just sitting at a desk than there is being involved in flashly programs or campaigns, or traversing through the jungle searching for unreached tribal people groups - at least for most missionaries that I know of.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would want to emphasize that from another angle, it is in fact quite full of glory - though in many ways, it is a “veiled glory,” to borrow the language of the Apostle Paul (2 Cor 4:3). It is not a glory that would appeal instantly to us in our flesh. In fact, taking the Apostle Paul himself as an example, it is a glory that the world despises, and can only be viewed through the eyes of faith, as we look forward to our eternal reward on that last day when Christ Himself returns.</p>

<p>It is also worth emphasizing that it is a glory that all of us can participate in, in whatever continent we happen to be in, inasmuch as all of us can be engaged in the ministry of the New Covenant. I pray that all of us would be found faithful before Him on that day, as we look forward with eager anticipation to the glory still to be revealed.</p>
